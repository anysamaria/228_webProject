<h2>Megan Thee Stallion</h2>

    <p>
    <em>Megan Thee Stallion</em> is a Houston born-and-raised rap artist, 
    whose music, style and personality I truly adore and admire so much. She is a huge inspiration to me 
    because of the way she carries herself and her brand as Megan Thee Stallion. Megans music, though 
    she is mainly a rap artist, encompasses many genres, from pop, to rock, to hip-hop. Exploring genres for 
    any artist can be difficult, but Megans music, no matter the genre, always feels very authentic to 
    her brand and image as Megan Thee Stallion. She is someone who exudes confidence, but is not afraid to 
    be “real,” talk about things personal to her as a human and public figure, and show her own weaknesses
    despite being upheld as a celebrity. The way she reflects herself into her art inspires me to achieve genuineness and to stay 
    true to myself and my style in my work, while also spreading myself out and having a versatile skill set.

<h2>PinkPantheress</h2>
    <p>
        <em>PinkPantheress,</em> real name Victoria and nicknamed 'Pink,' is a 24-year-old British singer, songwriter and producer, 
        who gained a majority of her popularity from uploading her music on social media sites such as YouTube and TikTok, all
        using GarageBand and her laptop. PinkPantheress never shies away from talking about her love of and passion for music, as 
        well as how dedicated she is toher craft. Her deep passion for what she does and how that translates into her music, brand 
        and visuals really fascinates and inspires me. Aside from loving her poppy, drum-and-bass music and her stunning unique
        visuals and aesthetic, her story of coming from nearly nothing, just her laptop and a dream, in a small town in the UK reminds
         me that I can do anything I put my mind and time to.

<h2>Eiichiro Oda</h2>
    <p><em>Eiichiro Oda</em> is a writer and manga artist, who is most known for being the creator and artist of the hit shonen-manga series, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRMG8ZQZR/one-piece">One Piece</a>, 
    under the Japanese Publishing Company, Shonen Jump. It's one of my favorite series, as well as the best
    selling manga series' in history. One Piece is also one of the longest anime and manga series, with 1100+ episodes and
    counting of the anime series running. I admire Oda for the love and dedication he pours into his work. Aside from constantly 
    interacting with fans and still actively participating in interviews about the series, Oda's love for his art and work shows through the thought 
    and detail put into every factor of One Piece, from the storyline, to individual character's story and details, and especially the art style and direction 
    — everything is so thoughtfully crafted to create the world that is One Piece over the nearly 28 years the series has been in running. I really respect the time
    and skill it takes to create a manga series, let alone be dedicated to a series that has been carefully planned for 20+ years. He inspires and somewhat reminds
     me to always love and put passion into what I work on.

 <h2>Elliot - @elliotisacoolguy</h2>
    <P>
        Elliot, known in online spaces as <em>'elliotisacoolguy,'</em> is a British social media content creator and graphic designer based in Australia. He is primarily on YouTube, making graphic design related content, but has 
        recently started a podcast centered around design, as well. I have been watching his videos and following his content for about a year, and I particularly admire his 
        style of design and his comedic educational videos. His ability to combine two niche things such as graphic design and comedy/satire into one is admirable. Aside 
        from his humor, I really admire his talent and eye for color and typography. I love how he is able to create interesting shapes and tell certain stories with type, 
        and how he utilizes bright, vivid hues without too much visual clutter or strain.
