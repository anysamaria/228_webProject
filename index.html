        Anysa has loved graphic design and has had a burning love for art from a young age. Introduced to their first graphic design class through an elective class in their freshman year of high school, intended to be nothing more than an attempt for elective credits, became Anysa’s gateway into the world of design. They have been interacting with Adobe softwares since then, and have since grown proficient in Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and After Effects. Anysa’s overarching goal for their design career as a whole is to extend themselves into different fields to see the many lens’ of design, from all eras of history and all over the world – to become more versed in the universe of design.

        Anysa is someone who lives and breathes on learning and knowledge of art. She describes her life as being consumed by creativity, as from a young age, she has always poured herself into creative outlets and hobbies, ranging from creating and listening to music, painting, reading, video games, curating social media content and especially, graphic design. She is inspired by the work, imagination and thought processes of other creatives she admires, and hopes her work can, one day, have the same effect and inspire and ignite others into action for creation. Anysa loves to immerse herself in the various worlds and stories of books, video games, movies and animations, and often draws inspiration from themes, messages and aesthetics presented in them.

Amongst their many hobbies, Anysa considers their two biggest burning passions to be collecting and video games. They love to collect and invest time and love into their many collections of various things, ranging from trading cards, to jewelry, to books and plushies.
